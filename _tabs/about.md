Hi there, I'm Faith Void! I'm 26 years old, use she/her + ae/aer pronouns, live in Tkaronto, Canada and I do a lot of tech things from fixing up older and newer computers, video game consoles, to doing web development and coding Linux applications and making Nintendo Switch homebrew! I also dabble in porting free/open-source video games to other platforms, with my current focuses being the Nintendo Switch, 3DS, and the original Xbox.
