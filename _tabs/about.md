Hi there, I'm Faith Void! I'm 26 years old, use she/her + ae/aer pronouns, live in Tkaronto, Canada and I do a lot of tech things, including fixing up computers of all eras, modding video game consoles, doing web development, working on Raspberry Pi / SBC projects and coding Linux & Nintendo Switch homebrew! I also dabble in porting free/open-source video games to other platforms, with my current focuses being the Nintendo Switch, 3DS, and the original Xbox.
