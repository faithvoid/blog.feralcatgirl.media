Hi there stranger, I'm Faith Void! Nice to meet you!

I'm a 26 year old agender (she/her or ae/aer) musician and freelance computer technician living in Tkaronto, Canada and I do a lot of tech-related things with my spare time, including fixing up computers of all eras, modding video game consoles, web development, working on Raspberry Pi / SBC projects and coding Linux scripts/applications & Nintendo Switch homebrew! I also dabble in porting free/open-source video games to other platforms, with my current focuses being the Nintendo Switch, 3DS, and the original Xbox.
