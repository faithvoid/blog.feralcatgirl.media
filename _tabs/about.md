Hi there, I'm Faith Void! I'm 26 years old, use she/her + ae/aer pronouns and I do a lot of tech things! From fixing up computers, consoles, to doing web development and coding Linux + Nintendo Switch applications! I also dabble in porting free/open-source video games to the Nintendo Switch that use Godot, Ren'Py, LOVE and ioquake3!
